Personal Interactive Resume set here to highlight ongoing development work in the field. This is built using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) as a front end application framework that interfaces with a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) CMS back end via RESTapi communication.

## Additional Highlights

* Usage of [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) carousel features
* Leveraging [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for consistent UI iconography

## Deployment Methodology

Decided on utilizing GitHub's embedded actions interface for a seamless CI/CD process to rapidly deploy updates to production by the way of confirming an appropriate pull request to the target deployment branch
